\"\"\"${1:Example Google style docstrings.}

${2:This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the \`Google Python
Style Guide\`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections are created
with a section header and a colon followed by a block of indented text.}

Example:
	${3:Examples can be given using either the \`\`Example\`\` or \`\`Examples\`\`
	sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
	literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.}

Attributes:
    ${4:module_level_variable1 (int): Module level variables may be documented in
        either the \`\`Attributes\`\` section of the module docstring, or in an
        inline docstring immediately following the variable.}
${5:
Todo:
    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use \`\`sphinx.ext.todo\`\` extension}
